### Application Structure

Although we call this an "Universal App", it has some specific structure:

- This is a tabbed app - it has one or more tabs, defined in the Google Spreadsheet.

- The first tab is assumed to be a "Home Screen".

- The Home screen has some buttons, which bring up "Detail Screens". It can also contain an image.

- Detail screens can contain HTML text, Images and YouTube videos

Do not confuse Detail screens with Tabs. Tabs top-level screens. Detail screens are pop-ups over the home screen.
