This will save a new Google Sheet with a name "My App" to your Google Drive, so you can modify it.

2. Publish your sheet and copy the published URL:

3. Now, in the mobile app, go to settings, add a new Sheet App, and paste the URL to connect to your new Google Sheet. This, in effect, will add a new Sheet App to your mobile App.

4. Interactively make changes to your Google Sheet and refresh the app the see your changes.
