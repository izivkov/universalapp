### Introduction ###

This is a simple hybrid mobile application allowing users to define its functionality by only manipulating its backing Google Spreadsheet. Instead of a traditional database for the back-end, it uses [Google Sheets](https://www.google.ca/sheets/about) to store data, content, behaviour and styling information. The app can keep a list of Google Sheets and switch between them, in effect switching to a different app. 

Some examples of applications which can be created are:

- Stock Portfolio
- Weather App
- Company Web Sites
- Various RSS Feeds

Here are some screenshots of sample applications which can be created:

A lot of the logic for the app can be implemented in the Google Sheets through sheet formulas, referring to oher sheets for the data, [scripting](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/overview), etc.
