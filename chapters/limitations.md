### Limitations

There is always a balance between flexibility and ease of use. This app is geared toward simplicity, and therefore we have applied some constraints:

- There is a specific structure: This ia a "tabbed" app with one or more Tabs. The Home screen contain Buttons which bring up Detail screens.
- The data is read-only. This means we cannot update the Google Sheets from the app. This was done to simplify end-user permissions.
