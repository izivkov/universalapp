### Nomenclature

Since the app can itself refer to multiple Google Sheets which define apps, the naming could be confusing. We refer to the Google Sheet as "Sheet App", and the mobile app as just "App". Similarly, tabs in a Googe Sheet are referred as "Sheet Tab", and a tab in the mobile app as just "Tab".
