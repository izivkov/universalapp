### Settings

This page allows the user to select the sheet app to use, add and delete. Each Google Spreadsheet defines a new sheet app.

When you select one of the sheets apps, the user is taken back to the homepage, with the new screen from the selected sheet app.

To add a new sheet app, copy the spreadsheet published link:

Once you paste the link into the dialog box, the sheet app's image and name will appear (defined in the app-info sheet tab of the spreadsheet):

Just press the **ADD** button on the dialog and the new sheet app will be added to the list of sheet apps.

To delete a sheet app, long-press on any of the sheets apps in the list, until check-boxes appear on the right. Select the sheet apps you like to delete, and press on the trash can button to delete them. You cannot delete the currently selected sheet app, since you need at least one sheet app to run the mobile app.

*Note that you are only deleting references to the spreadsheet from the mobile app, not the actual scpreadsheets.*

You can also reset the the settings to default by pressing the ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R1RGkstRdr6Hn5b1wHI20ujpgKe1thtfbi4qoLV4vEyYwu-ys9Al5KC8a-KlMUrpSxY0C-OSuaNKF30=w1600-h1134) button. This will remove all the added apps except the default one.
